            <p>
                This Hackathon will run from 9th of June through to the 23rd of June.
                That's two whole weeks to create something.👏 You can work alone, or in a team
                of up to 3 people! Form your own team of people you know or be your own Main Character.🧙‍♀️
                We want you to have some freedom and time during this event to get something done. Something
                that will be pitted against other teams with a winner being crowned at the end. 🏆

                The brief is basic and simple. Build a single level of a Game, that must have a defined start
                and end. 🎮 You can build it using whatever you wish and for whatever medium but it must be
                in a playable state for us to judge. Want to use Unity? Go ahead. PhaserJS and make it a browser
                game, or maybe Pygame? Go for it! Literally there is no limitation on how you build it. As an example
                we built this entire site using ThreeJS, where you can fly around the galaxy and find 3D objects.
                It's not a level of a game, but the environment could be <i>part</i> of a game.
