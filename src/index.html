                Running from 9th of June through to the 23rd of June. You can work alone, or in a team
                of up to 3 people! With your project being pitted against other teams with a winner
                being crowned at the end. 🏆
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-1">
                The brief is basic and simple. Build a single level of a Game, that must have a defined start
                and end. 🎮 You can build it using whatever you wish but it must be in a playable state for us
                to judge. Want to use Unity? Or PhaserJS and make it a browser game? Go for it! Literally there
                is no limitation on how you build it.
            </p>
